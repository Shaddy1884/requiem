2. Creating a program with which you are aiming solely to achieve interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, and that have not previously been readily available to the person engaging in the circumvention, to the extent any such acts of identification and analysis do not constitute infringement under the relevant works.

3. Examining the encryption used in the Fairplay DRM system.

Any other use of this program may not be classified as legal, and is the full responsibility of the person(s) utilising the program for the unapproved practice.
